        "content": "# Remixing an Open Book  \nIt is quite natural for academics who are continuously told to “publish or perish” to want to always create something from scratch that is their own fresh creation. This book is an experiment in not starting from scratch, but instead “remixing” the book titled Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist written by Allen B. Downey, Jeff Elkner, and others.  \nIn December of 2009, I was preparing to teach SI502 - Networked Programming at the University of Michigan for the fifth semester in a row and decided it was time to write a Python textbook that focused on exploring data instead of understanding algorithms and abstractions. My goal in SI502 is to teach people lifelong data handling skills using Python. Few of my students were planning to be professional computer programmers. Instead, they planned to be librarians, managers, lawyers, biologists, economists, etc., who happened to want to skillfully use technology in their chosen field.  \nI never seemed to find the perfect data-oriented Python book for my course, so I set out to write just such a book. Luckily at a faculty meeting three weeks before I was about to start my new book from scratch over the holiday break, Dr. Atul Prakash showed me the Think Python book which he had used to teach his Python course that semester. It is a well-written Computer Science text with a focus on short, direct explanations and ease of learning.",

        "content": "The overall book structure has been changed to get to doing data analysis problems as quickly as possible and have a series of running examples and exercises about data analysis from the very beginning.  \nChapters 2–10 are similar to the Think Python book, but there have been major changes. Number-oriented examples and exercises have been replaced with dataoriented exercises. Topics are presented in the order needed to build increasingly sophisticated data analysis solutions. Some topics like try and except are pulled forward and presented as part of the chapter on conditionals. Functions are given very light treatment until they are needed to handle program complexity rather than introduced as an early lesson in abstraction. Nearly all user-defined functions have been removed from the example code and exercises outside of Chapter 4. The word “recursion”1 does not appear in the book at all.  \nIn chapters 1 and 11–16, all of the material is brand new, focusing on real-world uses and simple examples of Python for data analysis including regular expressions for searching and parsing, automating tasks on your computer, retrieving data across the network, scraping web pages for data, object-oriented programming, using web services, parsing XML and JSON data, creating and using databases using Structured Query Language, and visualizing data.",

Downey’s Think Python book. Because there is a lot of overlap between the two books, students will quickly pick up skills in the additional areas of technical programming and algorithmic thinking that are covered in Think Python. And given that the books have a similar writing style, they should be able to move quickly through Think Python with a minimum of effort.  \nAs the copyright holder of Think Python, Allen has given me permission to change the book’s license on the material from his book that remains in this book from the GNU Free Documentation License to the more recent Creative Commons Attribution — Share Alike license. This follows a general shift in open documentation licenses moving from the GFDL to the CC-BY-SA (e.g., Wikipedia). Using the CC-BY-SA license maintains the book’s strong copyleft tradition while making it even more straightforward for new authors to reuse this material as they see fit.",

You can write programs for many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a problem. This book assumes that everyone needs to know how to program, and that once you know how to program you will figure out what you want to do with your newfound skills.  \nWe are surrounded in our daily lives with computers ranging from laptops to cell phones. We can think of these computers as our “personal assistants” who can take care of many things on our behalf. The hardware in our current-day computers is essentially built to continuously ask us the question, “What would you like me to do next?”  \nProgrammers add an operating system and a set of applications to the hardware and we end up with a Personal Digital Assistant that is quite helpful and capable of helping us do many different things.  \nOur computers are fast and have vast amounts of memory and could be very helpful to us if we only knew the language to speak to explain to the computer what we would like it to “do next”. If we knew this language, we could tell the computer to do tasks on our behalf that were repetitive. Interestingly, the kinds of things computers can do best are often the kinds of things that we humans find boring and mind-numbing.",

While you were able to read and understand the words in a few seconds, counting them is almost painful because it is not the kind of problem that human minds are designed to solve. For a computer, the opposite is true, reading and understanding text from a piece of paper is hard for a computer to do but counting the words and telling you how many times the most used word was used is very easy for the computer:  \npython words.py Enter file: words.txt to 16  \nOur “personal information analysis assistant” quickly told us that the word “to” was used sixteen times in the first three paragraphs of this chapter.  \nThis very fact that computers are good at things that humans are not is why you need to become skilled at talking “computer language”. Once you learn this new language, you can delegate mundane tasks to your partner (the computer), leaving more time for you to do the things that you are uniquely suited for.

Building useful, elegant, and clever programs for others to use is a very creative activity. Your computer or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) usually contains many different programs from many different groups of programmers, each competing for your attention and interest. They try their best to meet your needs and give you a great user experience in the process. In some situations, when you choose a piece of software, the programmers are directly compensated because of your choice.  \nIf we think of programs as the creative output of groups of programmers, perhaps the following figure is a more sensible version of our PDA:  \nFor now, our primary motivation is not to make money or please end users, but instead for us to be more productive in handling the data and information that we will encounter in our lives. When you first start, you will be both the programmer and the end user of your programs. As you gain skill as a programmer and programming feels more creative to you, your thoughts may turn toward developing programs for others.  \n![](images/b07da387853726b500678bb7821b71c2289c4e586653cb5e7584d40957739ea6.jpg)\nFigure 1.3: Hardware Architecture",

If you were to take apart your computer or cell phone and look deep inside, you would find the following parts:  \nThe high-level definitions of these parts are as follows:  \n• The Central Processing Unit (or CPU) is the part of the computer that is built to be obsessed with “what is next?” If your computer is rated at 3.0 Gigahertz, it means that the CPU will ask “What next?” three billion times per second. You are going to have to learn how to talk fast to keep up with the CPU.\n• The Main Memory is used to store information that the CPU needs in a hurry. The main memory is nearly as fast as the CPU. But the information stored in the main memory vanishes when the computer is turned off.\n• The Secondary Memory is also used to store information, but it is much slower than the main memory. The advantage of the secondary memory is that it can store information even when there is no power to the computer. Examples of secondary memory are disk drives or flash memory (typically found in USB sticks and portable music players).\n• The Input and Output Devices are simply our screen, keyboard, mouse, microphone, speaker, touchpad, etc. They are all of the ways we interact with the computer.",

So in a sense, the network is a slower and at times unreliable form of Secondary Memory.  \nWhile most of the detail of how these components work is best left to computer builders, it helps to have some terminology so we can talk about these different parts as we write our programs.  \n![](images/84f61f88311a65a8eae1377dee863cbff0233cb7a82726ad49ce32d060fdd4ca.jpg)\nFigure 1.4: Where Are You?  \nAs a programmer, your job is to use and orchestrate each of these resources to solve the problem that you need to solve and analyze the data you get from the solution. As a programmer you will mostly be “talking” to the CPU and telling it what to do next. Sometimes you will tell the CPU to use the main memory, secondary memory, network, or the input/output devices.  \nYou need to be the person who answers the CPU’s “What next?” question. But it would be very uncomfortable to shrink you down to 5mm tall and insert you into the computer just so you could issue a command three billion times per second. So instead, you must write down your instructions in advance. We call these stored instructions a program and the act of writing these instructions down and getting the instructions to be correct programming.",

In the end you will be a programmer - perhaps not a professional programmer, but at least you will have the skills to look at a data/information analysis problem and develop a program to solve the problem.  \nIn a sense, you need two skills to be a programmer:  \n• First, you need to know the programming language (Python) - you need to know the vocabulary and the grammar. You need to be able to spell the words in this new language properly and know how to construct well-formed “sentences” in this new language.\n• Second, you need to “tell a story”. In writing a story, you combine words and sentences to convey an idea to the reader. There is a skill and art in constructing the story, and skill in story writing is improved by doing some writing and getting some feedback. In programming, our program is the “story” and the problem you are trying to solve is the “idea”.  \nOnce you learn one programming language such as Python, you will find it much easier to learn a second programming language such as JavaScript or C++.

These are words that have very special meaning to Python. When Python sees these words in a Python program, they have one and only one meaning to Python. Later as you write programs you will make up your own words that have meaning to you called variables. You will have great latitude in choosing your names for your variables, but you cannot use any of Python’s reserved words as a name for a variable.  \nWhen we train a dog, we use special words like “sit”, “stay”, and “fetch”. When you talk to a dog and don’t use any of the reserved words, they just look at you with a quizzical look on their face until you say a reserved word. For example, if you say, “I wish more people would walk to improve their overall health”, what most dogs likely hear is, “blah blah blah walk blah blah blah blah.” That is because “walk” is a reserved word in dog language. Many might suggest that the language between humans and cats has no reserved words1.  \nThe reserved words in the language where humans talk to Python include the following:",

When you say “try”, Python will try every time you say it without fail.  \nWe will learn these reserved words and how they are used in good time, but for now we will focus on the Python equivalent of “speak” (in human-to-dog language).

And in just a few more chapters, you will be one of those programmers using Python to talk to the users of your program.  \nBefore we leave our first conversation with the Python interpreter, you should probably know the proper way to say “good-bye” when interacting with the inhabitants of Planet Python:  \n```txt\n>>> good-bye\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'good' is not defined\n>>> if you don't mind, I need to leave\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1\nif you don't mind, I need to leave\n```  \n```txt\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)\n>>> quit()\n```  \nYou will notice that the error is different for the first two incorrect attempts. The second error is different because if is a reserved word and Python saw the reserved word and thought we were trying to say something but got the syntax of the sentence wrong.",

Other high-level languages include Java, C++, PHP, Ruby, Basic, Perl, JavaScript, and many more. The actual hardware inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU) does not understand any of these high-level languages.  \nThe CPU understands a language we call machine language. Machine language is very simple and frankly very tiresome to write because it is represented all in zeros and ones:  \n001010001110100100101010000001111  \n11100110000011101010010101101101  \nMachine language seems quite simple on the surface, given that there are only zeros and ones, but its syntax is even more complex and far more intricate than Python. So very few programmers ever write machine language. Instead we build various translators to allow programmers to write in high-level languages like Python or JavaScript and these translators convert the programs to machine language for actual execution by the CPU.  \nSince machine language is tied to the computer hardware, machine language is not portable across different types of hardware. Programs written in high-level languages can be moved between different computers by using a different interpreter on the new machine or recompiling the code to create a machine language version of the program for the new machine.",

Python is an interpreter and when we are running Python interactively, we can type a line of Python (a sentence) and Python processes it immediately and is ready for us to type another line of Python.  \nSome of the lines of Python tell Python that you want it to remember some value for later. We need to pick a name for that value to be remembered and we can use that symbolic name to retrieve the value later. We use the term variable to refer to the labels we use to refer to this stored data.  \n>>> x = 6  \n>>> print(x)  \n6  \n>>> y = x * 7  \n```txt\n>>> print(y)\n42\n>>>\n```  \nIn this example, we ask Python to remember the value six and use the label $x$ s o we can retrieve the value later. We verify that Python has actually remembered the value using print. Then we ask Python to retrieve $x$ and multiply it by seven and put the newly computed value in $y$ . Then we ask Python to print out the value currently in $y$ .  \nEven though we are typing these commands into Python one line at a time, Python is treating them as an ordered sequence of statements with later statements able to retrieve data created in earlier statements.

In Linux and Macintosh, there is no suffix that uniquely marks a file as executable.  \nIf you were to open an executable file in a text editor, it would look completely crazy and be unreadable:  \n```txt\n?ELF\\~A\\~A\\~@\\~@\\~@\\~@\\~@\\~B\\~C\\~A\\~@\\~@\\~xa0\\x82 D\\~H4\\~@\\~@\\~x90\\~] \\~@\\~@\\~@\\~@4\\~G@(\\~$!!\\~F@ @\\~4\\~@\\~4\\t80D\\~H4\\t80D\\~H\\txe0\\~@\\~@\\~xe0\\~@\\~E @\\~@\\~D\\~@\\~@C\\~@\\~@T\\~A\\~@\\~T\\t81D\\~HT\\t81D\\~HS @\\~@\\~S\\~@\\~@D\\~@\\~@A\\~@\\~A\\dHQVhT\\t83D\\~H\\txe8\n```  \nIt is not easy to read or write machine language, so it is nice that we have interpreters and compilers that allow us to write in high-level languages like Python or C.  \nNow at this point in our discussion of compilers and interpreters, you should be wondering a bit about the Python interpreter itself.

In a command window, you would type python hello.py as follows:  \n```txt\n$ cat hello.py\nprint('Hello world!')\n$ python hello.py\nHello world!\n```  \nThe “$” is the operating system prompt, and the “cat hello.py” is showing us that the file “hello.py” has a one-line Python program to print a string.  \nWe call the Python interpreter and tell it to read its source code from the file “hello.py” instead of prompting us for lines of Python code interactively.  \nYou will notice that there was no need to have quit() at the end of the Python program in the file.

You could print out the stream of Facebook posts and pore over the text looking for the most common word, but that would take a long time and be very mistake prone. You would be smart to write a Python program to handle the task quickly and accurately so you can spend the weekend doing something fun.  \nFor example, look at the following text about a clown and a car.

While Python seems to like everyone else, Python knows them personally and holds a grudge against them. Because of this grudge, Python takes our perfectly written programs and rejects them as “unfit” just to torment us.  \n```txt\n>>> primit 'Hello world!'\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1\nprimit 'Hello world!'\n```  \nSyntaxError: invalid syntax  \n```txt\n>>> print ('Hello world')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n```  \nNameError: name 'primt' is not defined.

A syntax error means that you have violated the “grammar” rules of Python. Python does its best to point right at the line and character where it noticed it was confused. The only tricky bit of syntax errors is that sometimes the mistake that needs fixing is actually earlier in the program than where Python noticed it was confused. So the line and character that Python indicates in a syntax error may just be a starting point for your investigation.  \nLogic errors A logic error is when your program has good syntax but there is a mistake in the order of the statements or perhaps a mistake in how the statements relate to one another. A good example of a logic error might be, “take a drink from your water bottle, put it in your backpack, walk to the library, and then put the top back on the bottle.”",

If you don’t understand what your program does, you can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in your head.  \nRunning experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests. But if you run experiments without thinking or reading your code, you might fall into a pattern I call “random walk programming”, which is the process of making random changes until the program does the right thing. Needless to say, random walk programming can take a long time.  \nYou have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental science. You should have at least one hypothesis about what the problem is. If there are two or more possibilities, try to think of a test that would eliminate one of them.  \nTaking a break helps with the thinking. So does talking. If you explain the problem to someone else (or even to yourself), you will sometimes find the answer before you finish asking the question.  \nBut even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many errors, or if the code you are trying to fix is too big and complicated. Sometimes the best option is to retreat, simplifying the program until you get to something that works and that you understand.",

When you were learning to speak, it was not a problem for your first few years that you just made cute gurgling noises. And it was OK if it took six months for you to move from simple vocabulary to simple sentences and took 5-6 more years to move from sentences to paragraphs, and a few more years to be able to write an interesting complete short story on your own.  \nWe want you to learn Python much more rapidly, so we teach it all at the same time over the next few chapters. But it is like learning a new language that takes time to absorb and understand before it feels natural. That leads to some confusion as we visit and revisit topics to try to get you to see the big picture while we are defining the tiny fragments that make up that big picture. While the book is written linearly, and if you are taking a course it will progress in a linear fashion, don’t hesitate to be very nonlinear in how you approach the material. Look forwards and backwards and read with a light touch. By skimming more advanced material without fully understanding the details, you can get a better understanding of the “why?” of programming. By reviewing previous material and even redoing earlier exercises, you will realize that you actually learned a lot of material even if the material you are currently staring at seems a bit impenetrable.",

You (and the interpreter) can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.  \nThe print statement also works for integers. We use the python command to start the interpreter.  \n```txt\npython\n>>> print(4)\n4\n```  \nIf you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you.  \n```txt\n>>> type('Hello, World!')\n<class 'str>\n>>> type(17)\n<class 'int'>\n```  \nNot surprisingly, strings belong to the type str and integers belong to the type int. Less obviously, numbers with a decimal point belong to a type called float, because these numbers are represented in a format called floating point.  \n```txt\n>>> type(3.2)\n<class 'float'>\n```  \nWhat about values like “17” and “3.2”? They look like numbers, but they are in quotation marks like strings.  \n```python\n>>>type('17')\n<class 'str'>\n>>>type('3.2')\n<class 'str'>\n```  \nThey’re strings.  \nWhen you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of three digits, as in 1,000,000.

For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention. The acronym $P E M D A S$ is a useful way to remember the rules:  \n• Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, 2 * (3-1) is 4, and $( 1 + 1 ) * * ( 5 - 2 )$ is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60, even if it doesn’t change the result.  \n• Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so 2**1+1 is 3, not 4, and 3*1**3 is 3, not 27.\n• M ultiplication and Division have the same precedence, which is higher than Addition and $S$ ubtraction, which also have the same precedence. So 2*3-1 is 5, not 4, and 6+4/2 is 8, not 5.\n• Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right. So the expression 5-3-1 is 1, not 3, because the 5-3 happens first and then 1 is subtracted from 2.  \nWhen in doubt, always put parentheses in your expressions to make sure the computations are performed in the order you intend.",

Python provides a built-in function called input that gets input from the keyboard1. When this function is called, the program stops and waits for the user to type something. When the user presses Return or Enter, the program resumes and input returns what the user typed as a string.  \n```txt\n>>> inp = input()\nSome sillystuff\n>>> print(inp)\nSome sillystuff\n```  \nBefore getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a prompt telling the user what to input. You can pass a string to input to be displayed to the user before pausing for input:  \n>>>name $=$ input('What is your name? $\\backslash \\mathbf{n}^{\\prime}$ What is your name?\nChuck\n>>>print(name)\nChuck  \nThe sequence \\n at the end of the prompt represents a newline, which is a special character that causes a line break. That’s why the user’s input appears below the prompt.  \nIf you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert the return value to int using the int() function:  \n```txt\n>>> prompt = 'What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\\n'\n>>> speed = input(prompt)\nWhat...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n17\n```  \n```txt\n>>> int.speed)\n17\n>>> int.speed + 5\n22\n```  \nBut if the user types something other than a string of digits, you get an error:  \n```txt\n>>> speed = input(prompt)\nWhat...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?",

In the beginning, this choice can be confusing both when you read a program and when you write your own programs. For example, the following three programs are identical in terms of what they accomplish, but very different when you read them and try to understand them.  \na = 35.0  \nb = 12.50  \n$\\texttt { c } = \\texttt { a } * \\texttt { b }$  \nprint(c)  \nhours = 35.0  \nrate = 12.50  \npay $=$ hours $^ *$ rate  \nprint(pay)  \nx1q3z9ahd = 35.0  \nx1q3z9afd = 12.50  \nx1q3p9afd = x1q3z9ahd * x1q3z9afd  \nprint(x1q3p9afd)  \nThe Python interpreter sees all three of these programs as exactly the same but humans see and understand these programs quite differently. Humans will most quickly understand the intent of the second program because the programmer has chosen variable names that reflect their intent regarding what data will be stored in each variable.  \nWe call these wisely chosen variable names “mnemonic variable names”. The word mnemonic2 means “memory aid”. We choose mnemonic variable names to help us remember why we created the variable in the first place.",

This is because beginning programmers have not yet memorized the reserved words (there are only 35 of them) and sometimes variables with names that are too descriptive start to look like part of the language and not just well-chosen variable names.  \nTake a quick look at the following Python sample code which loops through some data. We will cover loops soon, but for now try to just puzzle through what this means:  \nfor word in words: print(word)  \nWhat is happening here? Which of the tokens (for, word, in, etc.) are reserved words and which are just variable names? Does Python understand at a fundamental level the notion of words? Beginning programmers have trouble separating what parts of the code must be the same as this example and what parts of the code are simply choices made by the programmer.  \nThe following code is equivalent to the above code:  \nfor slice in pizza: print(slice)  \nIt is easier for the beginning programmer to look at this code and know which parts are reserved words defined by Python and which parts are simply variable names chosen by the programmer. It is pretty clear that Python has no fundamental understanding of pizza and slices and the fact that a pizza consists of a set of one or more slices.",

Because of the definition of and, if $_ \\texttt { x }$ is less than 2, the expression $\\texttt { x } > = \\texttt { 2 }$ is False and so the whole expression is False regardless of whether (x/y) > 2 evaluates to True or False.  \nWhen Python detects that there is nothing to be gained by evaluating the rest of a logical expression, it stops its evaluation and does not do the computations in the rest of the logical expression. When the evaluation of a logical expression stops because the overall value is already known, it is called short-circuiting the evaluation.  \nWhile this may seem like a fine point, the short-circuit behavior leads to a clever technique called the guardian pattern. Consider the following code sequence in the Python interpreter:  \n```txt\n>>> x = 6\n>>> y = 2\n>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2\nTrue\n>>> x = 1\n>>> y = 0\n>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2\nFalse\n>>> x = 6\n>>> y = 0\n>>> x >= 2 and (x/y) > 2\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n>>>\n```",

To convert from degrees to radians, divide by 360 and multiply by $2 \\pi$ :  \n>>> degrees $= ~ 4 5$ >>> radians $=$ degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi >>> math.sin(radians) 0.7071067811865476  \nThe expression math.pi gets the variable pi from the math module. The value of this variable is an approximation of $\\pi$ , accurate to about 15 digits.",

Determinism is usually a good thing, since we expect the same calculation to yield the same result. For some applications, though, we want the computer to be unpredictable. Games are an obvious example, but there are more.  \nMaking a program truly nondeterministic turns out to be not so easy, but there are ways to make it at least seem nondeterministic. One of them is to use algorithms that generate pseudorandom numbers. Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random because they are generated by a deterministic computation, but just by looking at the numbers it is all but impossible to distinguish them from random.  \nThe random module provides functions that generate pseudorandom numbers (which I will simply call “random” from here on).  \nThe function random returns a random float between 0.0 and 1.0 (including 0.0 but not 1.0). Each time you call random, you get the next number in a long series. To see a sample, run this loop:  \nimport random  \nfor i in range(10): x = random.random() print(x)  \nThis program produces the following list of 10 random numbers between 0.0 and up to but not including 1.0.  \n0.11132867921152356 0.5950949227890241 0.04820265884996877 0.841003109276478 0.997914947094958 0.04842330803368111 0.7416295948208405 0.510535245390327 0.27447040171978143 0.028511805472785867",

        "content": "# 4.6 Adding new functions  \nSo far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python, but it is also possible to add new functions. A function definition specifies the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that execute when the function is called. Once we define a function, we can reuse the function over and over throughout our program.  \nHere is an example:  \n```python\ndef print_lyrics():\nprint(\"I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\")\nprint('I sleep all night and I work all day.')\n```  \ndef is a keyword that indicates that this is a function definition. The name of the function is print_lyrics. The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the first character can’t be a number. You can’t use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same name.  \nThe empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn’t take any arguments. Later we will build functions that take arguments as their inputs.  \nThe first line of the function definition is called the header; the rest is called the body. The header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, the indentation is always four spaces. The body can contain any number of statements.  \nIf you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter prints ellipses (. . . ) to let you know that the definition isn’t complete:  \n```python",

For example, to repeat the previous refrain, we could write a function called repeat_lyrics:  \n```python\ndef repeat_lyrics():\nprint_lyrics()\nprint_lyrics()\n```  \nAnd then call repeat_lyrics:  \n```txt\n>>> repeat_lyrics()\nI'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\nI sleep all night and I work all day.\nI'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\nI sleep all night and I work all day.\n```  \nBut that’s not really how the song goes.",

In other words, the function definition has to be executed before the first time it is called.  \nExercise 2: Move the last line of this program to the top, so the function call appears before the definitions.

Statements are executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom.  \nFunction definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called.  \nA function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the body of the function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.  \nThat sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the statements in another function. But while executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet another function!  \nFortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it terminates.  \nWhat’s the moral of this sordid tale? When you read a program, you don’t always want to read from top to bottom. Sometimes it makes more sense if you follow the flow of execution.",

Here is an example of a user-defined function that takes an argument:  \n```python\ndef print_twice(bruce):\nprint(bruce)\nprint(bruce)\n```  \nThis function assigns the argument to a parameter named bruce.

Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n• Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.\n• Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.  \nThroughout the rest of the book, often we will use a function definition to explain a concept. Part of the skill of creating and using functions is to have a function properly capture an idea such as “find the smallest value in a list of values”. Later we will show you code that finds the smallest in a list of values and we will present it to you as a function named min which takes a list of values as its argument and returns the smallest value in the list.",

Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly. Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it easier.  \nOne form of iteration in Python is the while statement. Here is a simple program that counts down from five and then says “Blastoff!”.  \n$\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{5}$ while $\\mathrm{n} > 0$ . print(n) n=n-1\nprint('Blastoff!')  \nYou can almost read the while statement as if it were English. It means, “While n is greater than 0, display the value of n and then reduce the value of n by 1. When you get to 0, exit the while statement and display the word Blastoff!”  \nMore formally, here is the flow of execution for a while statement:  \n1. Evaluate the condition, yielding True or False.\n2. If the condition is false, exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement.\n3. If the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to step 1.  \nThis type of flow is called a loop because the third step loops back around to the top. We call each time we execute the body of the loop an iteration. For the above loop, we would say, “It had five iterations”, which means that the body of the loop was executed five times.",

We call the while statement an indefinite loop because it simply loops until some condition becomes False, whereas the for loop is looping through a known set of items so it runs through as many iterations as there are items in the set.  \nThe syntax of a for loop is similar to the while loop in that there is a for statement and a loop body:  \n```python\nfriends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']\nfor friend in friends:\nprint('Happy New Year: ', friend)\nprint('Done!')\n```  \nIn Python terms, the variable friends is a list1 of three strings and the for loop goes through the list and executes the body once for each of the three strings in the list resulting in this output:  \nHappy New Year: Joseph Happy New Year: Glenn Happy New Year: Sally Done!  \nTranslating this for loop to English is not as direct as the while, but if you think of friends as a set, it goes like this: “Run the statements in the body of the for loop once for each friend in the set named friends.”  \nLooking at the for loop, for and in are reserved Python keywords, and friend and friends are variables.  \nfor friend in friends: print('Happy New Year:', friend)",

While the loop is executing, the value of count is the number of values we have seen “so far”.  \nOnce the loop completes, the value of count is the total number of items. The total number “falls in our lap” at the end of the loop. We construct the loop so that we have what we want when the loop finishes.  \nAnother similar loop that computes the total of a set of numbers is as follows:  \ntotal $= 0$ for itervar in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]: total $=$ total $^+$ itervar\nprint('Total: ', total)",

So before the loop starts total is zero because we have not yet seen any values, during the loop total is the running total, and at the end of the loop total is the overall total of all the values in the list.  \nAs the loop executes, total accumulates the sum of the elements; a variable used this way is sometimes called an accumulator.  \nNeither the counting loop nor the summing loop are particularly useful in practice because there are built-in functions len() and sum() that compute the number of items in a list and the total of the items in the list respectively.",

Look at the middle of the program, or near it, for an intermediate value you can check.

If it is correct, the problem is in the second half.  \nEvery time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of lines you have to search. After six steps (which is much less than 100), you would be down to one or two lines of code, at least in theory.  \nIn practice it is not always clear what the “middle of the program” is and not always possible to check it. It doesn’t make sense to count lines and find the exact midpoint. Instead, think about places in the program where there might be errors and places where it is easy to put a check. Then choose a spot where you think the chances are about the same that the bug is before or after the check.",

Often they start at the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the end. This pattern of processing is called a traversal. One way to write a traversal is with a while loop:  \nindex $= 0$ while index $<$ len(fruit): letter $=$ fruit[index] print(letter) index $=$ index $+1$  \nThis loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by itself. The loop condition is index < len(fruit), so when index is equal to the length of the string, the condition is false, and the body of the loop is not executed. The last character accessed is the one with the index len(fruit)-1, which is the last character in the string.  \nExercise 1: Write a while loop that starts at the last character in the string and works its way backwards to the first character in the string, printing each letter on a separate line, except backwards.  \nAnother way to write a traversal is with a for loop:  \nfor char in fruit: print(char)  \nEach time through the loop, the next character in the string is assigned to the variable char.

It is where all of the “thinking” happens.\n\nBut if you recall from our hardware architecture discussions, once the power is turned off, anything stored in either the CPU or main memory is erased. So up to now, our programs have just been transient fun exercises to learn Python.\n\nIn this chapter, we start to work with Secondary Memory (or files). Secondary memory is not erased when the power is turned off. Or in the case of a USB flash drive, the data we write from our programs can be removed from the system and transported to another system.\n\nWe will primarily focus on reading and writing text files such as those we create in a text editor. Later we will see how to work with database files which are binary files, specifically designed to be read and written through database software.\n\n# 7.2 Opening files",

        "content": "# 7.2 Opening files\n\nWhen we want to read or write a file (say on your hard drive), we first must open the file. Opening the file communicates with your operating system, which knows where the data for each file is stored. When you open a file, you are asking the operating system to find the file by name and make sure the file exists. In this example, we open the file mbox.txt, which should be stored in the same folder that you are in when you start Python. You can download this file from www.py4e.com/code3/mbox.txt\n\n```python\n>>> fhand = open('mbox.txt')\n>>> print(fhand)\n<io.TextIOWrapper name='mbox.txt' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'>\n```\n\n![](images/b6ee5abd7a13deaf62b1a13fcfe4898745324eb36bea1aaa7cc23c208613cb81.jpg)\n\n![](images/36a89fb2fa3f013ee2bdd7ee0dc666b14851f8eff35dd4eb5c2e26f2ec814a61.jpg)\nFigure 7.1: Secondary Memory\nFigure 7.2: A File Handle\n\nIf the open is successful, the operating system returns us a file handle. The file handle is not the actual data contained in the file, but instead it is a “handle” that we can use to read the data. You are given a handle if the requested file exists and you have the proper permissions to read the file.\n\nIf the file does not exist, open will fail with a traceback and you will not get a handle to access the contents of the file:\n\n```txt\n>>> fhand = open('stuff.txt')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'stuff.txt'\n```",

For example, this is a sample of a text file which records mail activity from various individuals in an open source project development team:\n\n```eml\nFrom stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008\nReturn-Path: <postmaster@collab.sakaiproject.org>\nDate: Sat, 5 Jan 2008 09:12:18 -0500\nTo: source@collab.sakaiproject.org\nFrom: stephen.Marquard@uct.ac.za\nSubject: [sakai] svn commit: r39772 - content/branches/\nDetails: http://source.sakaiproject.org/viewsvcn/?view=rev&rev=39772\n```\n\nThe entire file of mail interactions is available from\n\nwww.py4e.com/code3/mbox.txt\n\nand a shortened version of the file is available from\n\nwww.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt\n\nThese files are in a standard format for a file containing multiple mail messages. The lines which start with “From” separate the messages and the lines which start with “From:” are part of the messages. For more information about the mbox format, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox.\n\nTo break the file into lines, there is a special character that represents the “end of the line” called the newline character.",

        "content": "To break the file into lines, there is a special character that represents the “end of the line” called the newline character.\n\nIn Python, we represent the newline character as a backslash-n in string constants. Even though this looks like two characters, it is actually a single character. When we look at the variable by entering “stuff” in the interpreter, it shows us the \\n in the string, but when we use print to show the string, we see the string broken into two lines by the newline character.\n\n```txt\n>>> stuff = 'Hello\\nWorld!'\n>>> stuff\n'Hello\\nWorld!'\n>>> print(stuff)\nHello\nWorld!\n>>> stuff = 'X\\nY'\n>>> print(stuff)\nX\nY\n>>> len(stuff)\n3\n```\n\nYou can also see that the length of the string X\\nY is three characters because the newline character is a single character.\n\nSo when we look at the lines in a file, we need to imagine that there is a special invisible character called the newline at the end of each line that marks the end of the line.\n\nSo the newline character separates the characters in the file into lines.\n\n# 7.4 Reading files\n\nWhile the file handle does not contain the data for the file, it is quite easy to construct a for loop to read through and count each of the lines in a file:\n\n```python\nfhand = open('mbox-short.txt')\ncount = 0\nfor line in fhand:\ncount = count + 1\nprint('Line Count: ', count)\n```\n\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/open.py",

Our for loop simply counts the number of lines in the file and prints them out. The rough translation of the for loop into English is, “for each line in the file represented by the file handle, add one to the count variable.”\n\nThe reason that the open function does not read the entire file is that the file might be quite large with many gigabytes of data. The open statement takes the same amount of time regardless of the size of the file. The for loop actually causes the data to be read from the file.\n\nWhen the file is read using a for loop in this manner, Python takes care of splitting the data in the file into separate lines using the newline character. Python reads each line through the newline and includes the newline as the last character in the line variable for each iteration of the for loop.\n\nBecause the for loop reads the data one line at a time, it can efficiently read and count the lines in very large files without running out of main memory to store the data. The above program can count the lines in any size file using very little memory since each line is read, counted, and then discarded.\n\nIf you know the file is relatively small compared to the size of your main memory, you can read the whole file into one string using the read method on the file handle.",

We use string slicing to print out the first 20 characters of the string data stored in inp.\n\nWhen the file is read in this manner, all the characters including all of the lines and newline characters are one big string in the variable inp. It is a good idea to store the output of read as a variable because each call to read exhausts the resource:\n\n```txt\n>>> fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')\n>>> print(len(fhand.read()))\n94626\n>>> print(len(fhand.read()))\n0\n```\n\nRemember that this form of the open function should only be used if the file data will fit comfortably in the main memory of your computer. If the file is too large to fit in main memory, you should write your program to read the file in chunks using a for or while loop.\n\n# 7.5 Searching through a file\n\nWhen you are searching through data in a file, it is a very common pattern to read through a file, ignoring most of the lines and only processing lines which meet a particular condition. We can combine the pattern for reading a file with string methods to build simple search mechanisms.",

So the QA team is the programmer’s best friend.\n\nSo now that we see the flaw in the program, we can elegantly fix it using the try/except structure. We need to assume that the open call might fail and add recovery code when the open fails as follows:\n\nfname $=$ input('Enter the file name:')\ntry: fhand $\\equiv$ open(fname)\nexcept: print('File cannot be opened:', fname) exit()\ncount $= 0$ for line in fhand: if line.startswith('Subject:'): count $=$ count +1\nprint('There were'，count，'subject lines in'，fname)\n\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/search7.py\n\nThe exit function terminates the program. It is a function that we call that never returns.

We use the term “Pythonic” when we are doing something the “Python way”. We might say that the above example is the Pythonic way to open a file.",

The goal to be “more Pythonic” captures the notion that programming is part engineering and part art. We are not always interested in just making something work, we also want our solution to be elegant and to be appreciated as elegant by our peers.\n\n# 7.8 Writing files\n\nTo write a file, you have to open it with mode “w” as a second parameter:\n\n```python\n>>> fout = open('output.txt', 'w')\n>>> print fout)\n<_io.TextIOWrapper name='output.txt' mode='w' encoding='cp1252'>\n```\n\nIf the file already exists, opening it in write mode clears out the old data and starts fresh, so be careful! If the file doesn’t exist, a new one is created.\n\nThe write method of the file handle object puts data into the file, returning the number of characters written. The default write mode is text for writing (and reading) strings.\n\n```txt\n>>> line1 = \"This here's the wattle,\\n\"\n>>> fout.line1)\n24\n```\n\nAgain, the file object keeps track of where it is, so if you call write again, it adds the new data to the end.\n\nWe must make sure to manage the ends of lines as we write to the file by explicitly inserting the newline character when we want to end a line. The print statement automatically appends a newline, but the write method does not add the newline automatically.",

When we are writing files, we want to explicitly close the files so as to leave nothing to chance.\n\n# 7.9 Debugging\n\nWhen you are reading and writing files, you might run into problems with whitespace. These errors can be hard to debug because spaces, tabs, and newlines are normally invisible:\n\n>>>s $\\equiv$ 12\\t3\\n4'\n>>>print(s)\n123\n4\n\nThe built-in function repr can help. It takes any object as an argument and returns a string representation of the object. For strings, it represents whitespace characters with backslash sequences:\n\n```python\n>>> print(repr(s))\n'1 2\\t 3\\n 4'\n```\n\nThis can be helpful for debugging.\n\nOne other problem you might run into is that different systems use different characters to indicate the end of a line. Some systems use a newline, represented \\n. Others use a return character, represented \\r. Some use both. If you move files between different systems, these inconsistencies might cause problems.",

In a string, the values are characters; in a list, they can be any type. The values in lists are called elements or sometimes items.\n\nThere are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets (“[\" and \"]”):\n\n[10, 20, 30, 40]\n\n['crunchy frog', 'ram bladder', 'lark vomit']\n\nThe first example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of three strings. The elements of a list don’t have to be the same type. The following list contains a string, a float, an integer, and (lo!) another list:\n\n['spam', 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]\n\nA list within another list is nested.\n\nA list that contains no elements is called an empty list; you can create one with empty brackets, [].\n\nAs you might expect, you can assign list values to variables:\n\n```txt\n>>> cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']\n>>> numbers = [17, 123]\n>>> empty = []\n>>> print(cheeses, numbers, empty)\n['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda'] [17, 123] []\n```\n\n# 8.2 Lists are mutable\n\nThe syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for accessing the characters of a string: the bracket operator. The expression inside the brackets specifies the index. Remember that the indices start at 0:\n\n>>> print(cheeses[0])",

    {
        "content": ">>> print(cheeses[0])\n\nCheddar\n\nUnlike strings, lists are mutable because you can change the order of items in a list or reassign an item in a list. When the bracket operator appears on the left side of an assignment, it identifies the element of the list that will be assigned.\n\n>>> numbers = [17, 123]\n\n>>> numbers[1] = 5\n\n>>> print(numbers)\n\n[17, 5]\n\nThe one-th element of numbers, which used to be 123, is now 5.\n\nYou can think of a list as a relationship between indices and elements. This relationship is called a mapping; each index “maps to” one of the elements.\n\nList indices work the same way as string indices:\n\n• Any integer expression can be used as an index.\n• If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get an IndexError.\n• If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list.\n\nThe in operator also works on lists.\n\n>>> cheeses $=$ ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']\n\n>>> 'Edam' in cheeses\n\nTrue\n\n>>> 'Brie' in cheeses\n\nFalse\n\n# 8.3 Traversing a list\n\nThe most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a for loop. The syntax is the same as for strings:\n\nfor cheese in cheeses:\n\nprint(cheese)\n\nThis works well if you only need to read the elements of the list. But if you want to write or update the elements, you need the indices. A common way to do that is to combine the functions range and len:\n\nfor i in range(len(numbers)): numbers[i] $=$ numbers[i] * 2",

        "content": "for i in range(len(numbers)): numbers[i] $=$ numbers[i] * 2\n\nThis loop traverses the list and updates each element. len returns the number of elements in the list. range returns a list of indices from 0 to $n - 1$ , where $n$ is the length of the list. Each time through the loop, i gets the index of the next element. The assignment statement in the body uses i to read the old value of the element and to assign the new value.\n\nA for loop over an empty list never executes the body:\n\nfor x in empty: print('This never happens.')\n\nAlthough a list can contain another list, the nested list still counts as a single element. The length of this list is four:\n\n['spam', 1, ['Brie', 'Roquefort', 'Pol le Veq'], [1, 2, 3]]\n\n# 8.4 List operations\n\nThe $^ +$ operator concatenates lists:\n\n```txt\n>>> a = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> b = [4, 5, 6]\n>>> c = a + b\n>>> print(c)\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nSimilarly, the $^ *$ operator repeats a list a given number of times:\n\n```txt\n>>> [0] * 4\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n>>> [1, 2, 3] * 3\n[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThe first example repeats four times. The second example repeats the list three times.\n\n# 8.5 List slices\n\nThe slice operator also works on lists:\n\n```txt\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n>>> t[1:3]\n['b', 'c']\n>>> t[:4]\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n>>> t[3:]\n```\n\nIf you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning. If you omit the second, the slice goes to the end. So if you omit both, the slice is a copy of the whole list.",

For example, append adds a new element to the end of a list:\n\n```txt\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> t.append('d')\n>>> print(t)\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n```\n\nextend takes a list as an argument and appends all of the elements:\n\n```txt\n>>> t1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> t2 = ['d', 'e']\n>>> t1 extend(t2)\n>>> print(t1)\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n```\n\nThis example leaves t2 unmodified.\n\nsort arranges the elements of the list from low to high:\n\n```txt\n>>> t = ['d', 'c', 'e', 'b', 'a']\n>>> t.sort()\n>>> print(t)\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n```\n\nMost list methods are void; they modify the list and return None. If you accidentally write t = t.sort(), you will be disappointed with the result.\n\n# 8.7 Deleting elements\n\nThere are several ways to delete elements from a list. If you know the index of the element you want, you can use pop:\n\n```txt\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> x = t.pop(1)\n>>> print(t)\n['a', 'c']\n>>> print(x)\nb\n```\n\npop modifies the list and returns the element that was removed.

I also avoid the letter “l” because it looks too much like the number “1”. So that’s why I use “t”.\n\nThe list function breaks a string into individual letters. If you want to break a string into words, you can use the split method:\n\n>>>s $=$ 'pining for the fjords'\n>>>t $=$ s.split()\n>>>print(t)\n['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']\n>>>print(t[2])\nthe\n\nOnce you have used split to break the string into a list of words, you can use the index operator (square bracket) to look at a particular word in the list.\n\nYou can call split with an optional argument called a delimiter that specifies which characters to use as word boundaries. The following example uses a hyphen as a delimiter:\n\n>>>s $=$ 'spam-spam-spam'\n>>>delIMITER $\\equiv$ '-\n>>>s.split(delIMITER)\n['spam', 'spam', 'spam']\n\njoin is the inverse of split. It takes a list of strings and concatenates the elements. join is a string method, so you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the list as a parameter:\n\n```python\n>>> t = ['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']\n>>> delimiter =''\n>>> delimiter.join(t)\n'pining for the fjords'\n```\n\nIn this case the delimiter is a space character, so join puts a space between words. To concatenate strings without spaces, you can use the empty string, \"\", as a delimiter.\n\n# 8.10 Parsing lines",

If you execute $\\texttt { a } = \\ [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]$ , a refers to a list object whose value is a particular sequence of elements. If another list has the same elements, we would say it has the same value.\n\n# 8.12 Aliasing\n\nIf $\\mathtt { a }$ refers to an object and you assign $\\texttt { b } = \\texttt { a }$ , then both variables refer to the same object:\n\n>>> a = [1, 2, 3]\n\n>>> b = a\n>>> b is a\n\nTrue\n\nThe association of a variable with an object is called a reference. In this example, there are two references to the same object.\n\nAn object with more than one reference has more than one name, so we say that the object is aliased.\n\nIf the aliased object is mutable, changes made with one alias affect the other:\n\n>>> b[0] = 17\n\n>>> print(a)\n\n[17, 2, 3]\n\nAlthough this behavior can be useful, it is error-prone. In general, it is safer to avoid aliasing when you are working with mutable objects.\n\nFor immutable objects like strings, aliasing is not as much of a problem. In this example:\n\na = 'banana'\n\nb = 'banana'\n\nit almost never makes a difference whether a and b refer to the same string or not.\n\n# 8.13 List arguments\n\nWhen you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference to the list.

For example, the append method modifies a list, but the $^ +$ operator creates a new list:\n\n```txt\n>>> t1 = [1, 2]\n>>> t2 = t1.append(3)\n>>> print(t1)\n[1, 2, 3]\n>>> print(t2)\nNone\n>>> t3 = t1 + [3]\n>>> print(t3)\n[1, 2, 3]\n>>> t1 is t3\nFalse\n```\n\nThis difference is important when you write functions that are supposed to modify lists. For example, this function does not delete the head of a list:\n\n```python\ndef bad_delete_head(t):\nt = t[1:]\n```\n\nThe slice operator creates a new list and the assignment makes $^ \\texttt { t }$ refer to it, but none of that has any effect on the list that was passed as an argument.\n\nAn alternative is to write a function that creates and returns a new list. For example, tail returns all but the first element of a list:\n\n```python\ndef tail(t): return t[1:]\n```\n\nThis function leaves the original list unmodified. Here’s how it is used:\n\n```txt\n>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> rest = tail(letters)\n>>> print(rest)\n['b', 'c']\n```",

Then write a function called middle that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all but the first and last elements.\n\n# 8.14 Debugging\n\nCareless use of lists (and other mutable objects) can lead to long hours of debugging. Here are some common pitfalls and ways to avoid them:\n\n1. Don’t forget that most list methods modify the argument and return None. This is the opposite of the string methods, which return a new string and leave the original alone.\n\nIf you are used to writing string code like this:\n\n```txt\nword = word.strip()\n```\n\nIt is tempting to write list code like this:\n\n```python\nt = t.sort() # WRONG!\n```\n\nBecause sort returns None, the next operation you perform with $^ \\texttt { t }$ is likely to fail.\n\nBefore using list methods and operators, you should read the documentation carefully and then test them in interactive mode. The methods and operators that lists share with other sequences (like strings) are documented at:\n\ndocs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations\n\nThe methods and operators that only apply to mutable sequences are documented at:\n\ndocs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types\n\n2.

For example, to remove an element from a list, you can use pop, remove, del, or even a slice assignment.\n\nTo add an element, you can use the append method or the $^ +$ operator. But don’t forget that these are right:\n\n```txt\nt.append(x)\n```\n\n$\\mathbf{t} = \\mathbf{t} + [\\mathbf{x}]$\n\nAnd these are wrong:\n\n```txt\nt.append([x]) #WRONG!\n```\n\n```txt\nt = t.append(x) # WRONG!\n```\n\n```txt\nt + [x] # WRONG!\n```\n\n```txt\nt = t + x # WRONG!\n```\n\nTry out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure you understand what they do. Notice that only the last one causes a runtime error; the other three are legal, but they do the wrong thing.\n\n3. Make copies to avoid aliasing.\n\nIf you want to use a method like sort that modifies the argument, but you need to keep the original list as well, you can make a copy.\n\norig $=$ t[:] t.sort()\n\nIn this example you could also use the built-in function sorted, which returns a new, sorted list and leaves the original alone. But in that case you should avoid using sorted as a variable name!\n\n4. Lists, split, and files\n\nWhen we read and parse files, there are many opportunities to encounter input that can crash our program so it is a good idea to revisit the guardian pattern when it comes to writing programs that read through a file and look for a “needle in the haystack”.",

Why didn’t we think of that when we were writing the code? When the code looks for the first word (word[0]) to check to see if it matches “From”, we get an “index out of range” error.\n\nThis of course is the perfect place to add some guardian code to avoid checking the first word if the first word is not there. There are many ways to protect this code; we will choose to check the number of words we have before we look at the first word:\n\n```python\nfhand = open('mbox-short.txt')\ncount = 0\nfor line in fhand:\nwords = line.split()",

Then we added a guardian statement that checks to see if we have zero words, and if so, we use continue to skip to the next line in the file.\n\nWe can think of the two continue statements as helping us refine the set of lines which are “interesting” to us and which we want to process some more. A line which has no words is “uninteresting” to us so we skip to the next line. A line which does not have “From” as its first word is uninteresting to us so we skip it.\n\nThe program as modified runs successfully, so perhaps it is correct. Our guardian statement does make sure that the words[0] will never fail, but perhaps it is not enough. When we are programming, we must always be thinking, “What might go wrong?”\n\nExercise 2: Figure out which line of the above program is still not properly guarded. See if you can construct a text file which causes the program to fail and then modify the program so that the line is properly guarded and test it to make sure it handles your new text file.\n\nExercise 3: Rewrite the guardian code in the above example without two if statements. Instead, use a compound logical expression using the or logical operator with a single if statement.\n\n# 8.15 Glossary",

In a list, the index positions have to be integers; in a dictionary, the indices can be (almost) any type.\n\nYou can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are called keys) and a set of values. Each key maps to a value. The association of a key and a value is called a key-value pair or sometimes an item.\n\nAs an example, we’ll build a dictionary that maps from English to Spanish words, so the keys and the values are all strings.\n\nThe function dict creates a new dictionary with no items. Because dict is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.\n\n>>>eng2sp $\\equiv$ dict()\n>>>print(eng2sp)\n{}\n\nThe curly brackets, $\\{ \\}$ , represent an empty dictionary. To add items to the dictionary, you can use square brackets:\n\n```txt\n>>> eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'\n```\n\nThis line creates an item that maps from the key 'one' to the value “uno”. If we print the dictionary again, we see a key-value pair with a colon between the key and value:\n\n```txt\n>>> print(eng2sp)\n{'one': 'uno'}\n```\n\nThis output format is also an input format. For example, you can create a new dictionary with three items.\n\n>>>eng2sp $\\equiv$ {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}\n>>>print(eng2sp)\n{'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}",

Instead, you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:\n\n```txt\n>>> print(eng2sp['two'])\n'dos'\n```\n\nThe key 'two' always maps to the value “dos” so the order of the items doesn’t matter.\n\nIf the key isn’t in the dictionary, you get an exception:\n\n```txt\n>>> print(eng2sp['four'])\nKeyError: 'four'\n```\n\nThe len function works on dictionaries; it returns the number of key-value pairs:\n\n```txt\n>>> len(eng2sp) 3\n```\n\nThe in operator works on dictionaries; it tells you whether something appears as a key in the dictionary (appearing as a value is not good enough).\n\n```txt\n>>> 'one' in eng2sp\nTrue\n>>> 'uno' in eng2sp\nFalse\n```\n\nTo see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary, you can use the method values, which returns the values as a type that can be converted to a list, and then use the in operator:\n\n```erlang\n>>> vals = list(eng2sp.values())\n>>> 'uno' in vals\nTrue\n```",

For lists, it uses a linear search algorithm. As the list gets longer, the search time gets longer in direct proportion to the length of the list. For dictionaries, Python uses an algorithm called a hash table that has a remarkable property: the in operator takes about the same amount of time no matter how many items there are in a dictionary. I won’t explain why hash functions are so magical, but you can read more about it at wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table.1\n\nExercise 1: Download a copy of the file\n\nwww.py4e.com/code3/words.txt\n\nWrite a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a dictionary.

You could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the alphabet. Then you could traverse the string and, for each character, increment the corresponding counter, probably using a chained conditional.\n2. You could create a list with 26 elements. Then you could convert each character to a number (using the built-in function ord), use the number as an index into the list, and increment the appropriate counter.\n3. You could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the corresponding values. The first time you see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary. After that you would increment the value of an existing item.\n\nEach of these options performs the same computation, but each of them implements that computation in a different way.\n\nAn implementation is a way of performing a computation; some implementations are better than others. For example, an advantage of the dictionary implementation is that we don’t have to know ahead of time which letters appear in the string and we only have to make room for the letters that do appear.\n\nHere is what the code might look like:\n\n```python\nword = 'brontosaurus'\nd = dict()\nfor c in word:\nif c not in d:\nd[c] = 1\nelse:\nd[c] = d[c] + 1\nprint(d)\n```\n\nWe are effectively computing a histogram, which is a statistical term for a set of counters (or frequencies).",

Each time through the loop, if $^ \\texttt { c }$ is not in the dictionary, we create a new item with key $^ \\texttt { c }$ and the initial value 1 (since we have seen this letter once). If $\\mathtt { c }$ is already in the dictionary we increment d[c].\n\nHere’s the output of the program:\n\n{'b': 1, 'r': 2, 'o': 2, 'n': 1, 't': 1, 's': 2, 'a': 1, 'u': 2}\n\nThe histogram indicates that the letters “a” and “b” appear once; “o” appears twice, and so on.\n\nDictionaries have a method called get that takes a key and a default value. If the key appears in the dictionary, get returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the default value. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> counts = {'chuck': 1, 'annie': 42, 'jan': 100}\n>>> print(counts.get('jan', 0))\n100\n>>> print(counts.get('tim', 0))\n0\n```\n\nWe can use get to write our histogram loop more concisely. Because the get method automatically handles the case where a key is not in a dictionary, we can reduce four lines down to one and eliminate the if statement.\n\n```python\nword = 'brontosaurus'\nd = dict()\nfor c in word:\nd[c] = d.get(c, 0) + 1\nprint(d)\n```",

So you should take a moment and compare the loop using the if statement and in operator with the loop using the get method. They do exactly the same thing, but one is more succinct.\n\n# 9.2 Dictionaries and files\n\nOne of the common uses of a dictionary is to count the occurrence of words in a file with some written text. Let’s start with a very simple file of words taken from the text of Romeo and Juliet.\n\nFor the first set of examples, we will use a shortened and simplified version of the text with no punctuation. Later we will work with the text of the scene with punctuation included.\n\nBut soft what light through yonder window breaks It is the east and Juliet is the sun Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief\n\nWe will write a Python program to read through the lines of the file, break each line into a list of words, and then loop through each of the words in the line and count each word using a dictionary.",

For example if we wanted to find all the entries in a dictionary with a value above ten, we could write the following code:\n\n```python\ncounts = {'chuck': 1, 'annie': 42, 'jan': 100}\nfor key in counts:\nif counts[key] > 10:\nprint(key, counts[key])\n```\n\nThe for loop iterates through the keys of the dictionary, so we must use the index operator to retrieve the corresponding value for each key.

Here are some suggestions for debugging large datasets:\n\nScale down the input If possible, reduce the size of the dataset. For example if the program reads a text file, start with just the first 10 lines, or with the smallest example you can find. You can either edit the files themselves, or (better) modify the program so it reads only the first n lines.",

For debugging this kind of error, it is often enough to print the type of a value.\n\nWrite self-checks Sometimes you can write code to check for errors automatically.

The values stored in a tuple can be any type, and they are indexed by integers. The important difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples are also comparable and hashable so we can sort lists of them and use tuples as key values in Python dictionaries.\n\nSyntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values:\n\n$$\n\\ggg t = ^ {\\prime} a ^ {\\prime}, ^ {\\prime} b ^ {\\prime}, ^ {\\prime} c ^ {\\prime}, ^ {\\prime} d ^ {\\prime}, ^ {\\prime} e ^ {\\prime}\n$$\n\nAlthough it is not necessary, it is common to enclose tuples in parentheses to help us quickly identify tuples when we look at Python code:\n\n$$\n\\ggg t = \\left(^ {\\prime} a ^ {\\prime}, ^ {\\prime} b ^ {\\prime}, ^ {\\prime} c ^ {\\prime}, ^ {\\prime} d ^ {\\prime}, ^ {\\prime} e ^ {\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nTo create a tuple with a single element, you have to include the final comma:\n\n```txt\n>>> t1 = ('a',)\n>>> type(t1)\n<type 'tuple'>\n```\n\nWithout the comma Python treats ('a') as an expression with a string in parentheses that evaluates to a string:\n\n```txt\n>>> t2 = ('a')\n>>> type(t2)\n<type 'str'>\n```\n\nAnother way to construct a tuple is the built-in function tuple. With no argument, it creates an empty tuple:\n\n```txt\n>>> t = tuple()\n>>> print(t)\n()\n```",

The bracket operator indexes an element:\n\n```txt\n>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')\n>>> print(t[0])\n'a'\n```\n\nAnd the slice operator selects a range of elements.\n\n```txt\n>>> print(t[1:3])\n('b', 'c')\n```\n\nBut if you try to modify one of the elements of the tuple, you get an error:\n\n```txt\n>>> t[0] = 'A'\nTypeError: object doesn't support item assignment\n```\n\nYou can’t modify the elements of a tuple, but you can replace one tuple with another:\n\n```python\n>>> t = ('A',) + t[1:]\n>>> print(t)\n('A', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')\n```\n\n# 10.2 Comparing tuples\n\nThe comparison operators work with tuples and other sequences. Python starts by comparing the first element from each sequence. If they are equal, it goes on to the next element, and so on, until it finds elements that differ. Subsequent elements are not considered (even if they are really big).\n\n```txt\n>>> (0, 1, 2) < (0, 3, 4)\nTrue\n>>> (0, 1, 2000000) < (0, 3, 4)\nTrue\n```\n\nThe sort function works the same way.

This allows you to assign more than one variable at a time to the given sequence.\n\nIn this example we have a two-element tuple and assign the first and second elements of the tuple to the variables $_ \\textrm { x }$ and y in a single statement.\n\n>>>m $=$ （'have'，'fun')\n>>>x，y=m\n>>>x\n'have'\n>>>y\n'fun'\n>>>\n\nThis is more general than tuple-to-tuple assignment. Both tuples and lists are sequences, so this syntax works with a two element list as well.\n\n```txt\n>>> m = ['have', 'fun']\n>>> x, y = m\n>>> x\n'have'\n>>> y\n'fun'\n>>>\n```\n\nIt is not magic, Python roughly translates the tuple assignment syntax to be the following:2\n\n```txt\n>>> m = ('have', 'fun')\n>>> x = m[0]\n>>> y = m[1]\n>>> x\n'have'\n>>> y\n'fun'\n>>>\n```\n\nStylistically when we use a tuple on the left side of the assignment statement, we omit the parentheses, but the following is an equally valid syntax:\n\n>>>m $=$ （'have'，'fun')\n>>> $\\mathrm{(x,y)} = \\mathrm{m}$ >>>x\n'have'\n\n```txt\n>>> y\n'fun'\n>>>\n```",

Each value on the right side is assigned to its respective variable on the left side. All the expressions on the right side are evaluated before any of the assignments.\n\nThe number of variables on the left and the number of values on the right must be the same:\n\n```txt\n>>> a, b = 1, 2, 3\nValueError: too many values to unpack\n```\n\nMore generally, the right side can be any kind of sequence (string, list, or tuple). For example, to split an email address into a user name and a domain, you could write:\n\n```txt\n>>> addr = 'monty@python.org'\n>>> uname, domain = addr.split '@')\n```\n\nThe return value from split is a list with two elements; the first element is assigned to uname, the second to domain.\n\n```txt\n>>> print(uname)\nmonty\n>>> print(domain)\npython.org\n```\n\n# 10.4 Dictionaries and tuples\n\nDictionaries have a method called items that returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair:\n\n>>>d $=$ {'b':1，'a':10，'c':22}\n>>>t $=$ list(d.items())\n>>>print(t）\n[('b'，1)，（'a'，10），(‘c'，22)]\n\nAs you should expect from a dictionary, the items are in non-alphabetical order.",

However Python provides the built-in functions sorted and reversed, which take any sequence as a parameter and return a new sequence with the same elements in a different order.\n\n# 10.9 List comprehension\n\nSometimes you want to create a sequence by using data from another sequence. You can achieve this by writing a for loop and appending one item at a time. For example, if you wanted to convert a list of strings – each string storing digits – into numbers that you can sum up, you would write:",

Compound data structures are useful, but they are prone to what I call shape errors; that is, errors caused when a data structure has the wrong type, size, or composition, or perhaps you write some code and forget the shape of your data and introduce an error. For example, if you are expecting a list with one integer and I give you a plain old integer (not in a list), it won’t work.\n\n# 10.11 Glossary\n\ncomparable A type where one value can be checked to see if it is greater than, less than, or equal to another value of the same type.

        "content": "This task of searching and extracting is so common that Python has a very powerful module called regular expressions that handles many of these tasks quite elegantly. The reason we have not introduced regular expressions earlier in the book is because while they are very powerful, they are a little complicated and their syntax takes some getting used to.\n\nRegular expressions are almost their own little programming language for searching and parsing strings. As a matter of fact, entire books have been written on the topic of regular expressions. In this chapter, we will only cover the basics of regular expressions. For more detail on regular expressions, see:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/library/re.html\n\nYou can also bookmark the following page to experiment with regular expressions as you learn:\n\nhttps://regex101.com/\n\nThe regular expression module re must be imported into your program before you can use it. The simplest use of the regular expression module is the search() function. The following program demonstrates a trivial use of the search function.\n\n# Search for lines that contain 'From'\n\nimport re\n\nhand $=$ open('mbox-short.txt')\n\nfor line in hand:\n\nline $=$ line.rstrip()\n\nif re.search('From:', line):\n\nprint(line)\n\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/re01.py",

This program does not use the real power of regular expressions, since we could have just as easily used line.find() to accomplish the same result.\n\nThe power of the regular expressions comes when we add special characters to the search string that allow us to more precisely control which lines match the string. Adding these special characters to our regular expression allows us to do sophisticated matching and extraction while writing very little code.\n\nFor example, the caret character is used in regular expressions to match “the beginning” of a line. We could change our program to only match lines where “From:” was at the beginning of the line as follows:\n\n```python\nSearch for lines that start with 'From'\nimport re\nhand = open('mdb-short.txt')\nfor line in hand:\nline = line.rstrip()\nif re.search('^From: ', line):\nprint(line)\n```\n\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/re02.py",

This is still a very simple example that we could have done equivalently with the startswith() method from the string module. But it serves to introduce the notion that regular expressions contain special action characters that give us more control as to what will match the regular expression.\n\n# 11.1 Character matching in regular expressions\n\nThere are a number of other special characters that let us build even more powerful regular expressions. The most commonly used special character is the period or full stop, which matches any character.\n\nIn the following example, the regular expression F..m: would match any of the strings “From:”, “Fxxm:”, “F12m:”, or “F!@m:” since the period characters in the regular expression match any character.\n\nSearch for lines that start with 'F', followed by # 2 characters, followed by 'm:'\nimport re\nhand $=$ open('mbox-short.txt')\nfor line in hand: line $=$ line.rstrip() if re.search('F..m:','line): print(line)\n\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/re03.py",

These special characters mean that instead of matching a single character in the search string, they match zero-or-more characters (in the case of the asterisk) or one-or-more of the characters (in the case of the plus sign).\n\nWe can further narrow down the lines that we match using a repeated wild card character in the following example:\n\n```python\nSearch for lines that start with From and have an at sign\nimport re\nhand = open('mbox-short.txt')\nfor line in hand:\nline = line.strip()\nif re.search('^From:.+@', line):\nprint(line)\n```\n\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/re04.py\n\nThe search string ˆFrom:.+@ will successfully match lines that start with “From:”, followed by one or more characters (.+), followed by an at-sign. So this will match the following line:\n\nFrom: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\n\nYou can think of the . $^ +$ wildcard as expanding to match all the characters between the colon character and the at-sign.\n\nFrom:.+@\n\nIt is good to think of the plus and asterisk characters as “pushy” or “greedy.” For example, the following string would match the last at-sign in the string as the . $^ +$ pushes outwards, the one in cwen@iupui.edu.\n\nFrom: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za, csev@umich.edu, and cwen@iupui.edu",

For more details, see the Python documentation on greedy vs non-greedy quantifiers.\n\n# 11.2 Extracting data using regular expressions\n\nIf we want to extract data from a string in Python we can use the findall() method to extract all of the substrings which match a regular expression. Let’s use the example of wanting to extract anything that looks like an email address from any line regardless of format. For example, we want to pull the email addresses from each of the following lines:\n\n```eml\nFrom stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008\nReturn-Path: <postmaster>collab.sakaiproject.org> for <source>collab.sakaiproject.org>;\nReceived: (from apache@localhost)\nAuthor: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\n```\n\nWe don’t want to write code for each of the types of lines, splitting and slicing differently for each line. This following program uses findall() to find the lines with email addresses in them and extract one or more addresses from each of those lines.\n\nimport re\ns = 'A message from csev@umich.edu to cwen@iupui.edu about meeting @2PM' lst $=$ re.findall(r'\\S+@\\S+\\*,s)\nprint(lst)",

We are using a twocharacter sequence that matches a non-whitespace character (\\S). You will notice we’ve also appended the letter r just before our regular expression; this tells Python to interpret our regular expression as a raw string, and not to treat backslashes as escape characters (like we use with \\n).\n\nThe output of the program would be:\n\n['csev@umich.edu', 'cwen@iupui.edu']\n\nTranslating the regular expression, we are looking for substrings that have at least one non-whitespace character, followed by an at-sign, followed by at least one more non-whitespace character. The \\S+ matches as many non-whitespace characters as possible.\n\nThe regular expression would match twice (csev@umich.edu and cwen@iupui.edu), but it would not match the string $@$ 2PM” because there are no non-blank characters before the at-sign. We can use this regular expression in a program to read all the lines in a file and print out anything that looks like an email address as follows:\n\n# Search for lines that have an at sign between characters\n\nimport re\nhand $=$ open('mbox-short.txt')\nfor line in hand: line $=$ line.rstrip() $\\mathbf{x} =$ re.findall(r'\\S+@\\S+\\*,line) iflen(x）>0: print(x)",

Since findall() returns a list, we simply check if the number of elements in our returned list is more than zero to print only lines where we found at least one substring that looks like an email address.\n\nIf we run the program on mbox-short.txt we get the following output:\n\n```txt\n[<source@collab.sakaiproject.org>;']\n['<source@collab.sakaiproject.org>;']\n['apache@localhost)']\n['source@collab.sakaiproject.org;']\n['cwen@iupui.edu']\n['source@collab.sakaiproject.org']\n['cwen@iupui.edu']\n['cwen@iupui.edu']\n['wagnermr@iupui.edu']\n```\n\nSome of our email addresses have incorrect characters like “ $<$ <” or “;” at the beginning or end. Let’s declare that we are only interested in the portion of the string that starts and ends with a letter or a number.\n\nTo do this, we use another feature of regular expressions. Square brackets are used to indicate a set of multiple acceptable characters we are willing to consider matching. In a sense, the \\S is asking to match the set of “non-whitespace characters”. Now we will be a little more explicit in terms of the characters we will match.\n\nHere is our new regular expression:\n\n```txt\n[a-zA-Z0-9]\\S*@\\S*[a-zA-Z]\n```",

While it would be simple enough to use split, we can use another feature of regular expressions to both search and parse the line at the same time.\n\nParentheses are another special character in regular expressions. When you add parentheses to a regular expression, they are ignored when matching the string. But when you are using findall(), parentheses indicate that while you want the whole expression to match, you only are interested in extracting a portion of the substring that matches the regular expression.\n\nSo we make the following change to our program:\n\nSearch for lines that start with 'X' followed by any non whitespace characters and ': ' followed by a space # and any number. The number can include a decimal. # Then print the number if it is greater than zero. import re\nhand $=$ open('mbox-short.txt')\nfor line in hand: line $=$ line.rstrip() $\\mathrm{x} =$ re.findall(r'\\~x\\.*:([0-9.]+),line) if len(x) $>0$ . print(x)\n\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/re11.py",

We want to find lines that match the entire expression but we only want to extract the integer number at the end of the line, so we surround [0-9]+ with parentheses, and we add $\\$ 1$ to indicate matches specifically at the end of the line.\n\nWhen we run the program, we get the following output:\n\n```javascript\n['39772'] ['39771'] ['39770'] ['39769']\n```\n\nRemember that the [0-9] $^ +$ is “greedy” and it tries to make as large a string of digits as possible before extracting those digits. This “greedy” behavior is why we get all five digits for each number. The regular expression module expands in both directions until it encounters a non-digit, or the beginning or the end of a line.\n\nNow we can use regular expressions to redo an exercise from earlier in the book where we were interested in the time of day of each mail message.

First the line was split into words and then we pulled out the fifth word and split it again on the colon character to pull out the two characters we were interested in.\n\nWhile this worked, it actually results in pretty brittle code that is assuming the lines are nicely formatted. If you were to add enough error checking (or a big try/except block) to ensure that your program never failed when presented with incorrectly formatted lines, the code would balloon to 10-15 lines of code that was pretty hard to read.\n\nWe can do this in a far simpler way with the following regular expression:\n\n^From .* [0-9][0-9]:\n\nThe translation of this regular expression is that we are looking for lines that start with From (note the space), followed by any number of characters $( . * )$ , followed by a space, followed by two digits [0-9][0-9], followed by a colon character. This is the definition of the kinds of lines we are looking for.\n\nIn order to pull out only the hour using findall(), we add parentheses around the two digits as follows:\n\n^From .* ([0-9][0-9]):\n\nThis results in the following program:\n\n```python\nSearch for lines that start with From and a character",

We need a way to indicate that we want to match the actual character such as a caret symbol, dollar sign, or period.\n\nWe can indicate that we want to simply match a character by prefixing that character with a backslash. For example, we can find money amounts with the following regular expression.\n\n```python\nimport re\nx = 'We just received $10.00 for cookies.'\ny = re.findall('\\\\[0-9.]+',x)\n```\n\nSince we prefix the dollar sign with a backslash, it actually matches the dollar sign in the input string instead of matching the “end of line”, and the rest of the regular expression matches one or more digits or the period character. Remember, as we saw above, inside square brackets, characters are not “special”. So when we say [0-9.], it really means digits or a period. Outside of square brackets, a period is the “wild-card” character and matches any character. Inside square brackets, the period is a period.",

Here are some of those special characters and character sequences:\n\nˆ Matches the beginning of the line.\n$\\$ 1$ Matches the end of the line.\n. Matches any character (a wildcard).\n\\s Matches a whitespace character.\n\\S Matches a non-whitespace character (opposite of \\s).\n$^ *$ Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero or more times.\n$^ *$ ?

You can both read from and write to the same socket. If you write something to a socket, it is sent to the application at the other end of the socket. If you read from the socket, you are given the data which the other application has sent.\n\nBut if you try to read a socket1 when the program on the other end of the socket has not sent any data, you just sit and wait. If the programs on both ends of the socket simply wait for some data without sending anything, they will wait for a very long time, so an important part of programs that communicate over the Internet is to have some sort of protocol.\n\nA protocol is a set of precise rules that determine who is to go first, what they are to do, and then what the responses are to that message, and who sends next, and so on. In a sense the two applications at either end of the socket are doing a dance and making sure not to step on each other’s toes.\n\nThere are many documents that describe these network protocols. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is described in the following document:\n\nhttps://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.txt",

Sockets can be used to communicate with a web server or with a mail server or many other kinds of servers. All that is needed is to find the document which describes the protocol and write the code to send and receive the data according to the protocol.\n\nHowever, since the protocol that we use most commonly is the HTTP web protocol, Python has a special library specifically designed to support the HTTP protocol for the retrieval of documents and data over the web.\n\nOne of the requirements for using the HTTP protocol is the need to send and receive data as bytes objects, instead of strings. In the preceding example, the encode() and decode() methods convert strings into bytes objects and back again.\n\nThe next example uses b'' notation to specify that a variable should be stored as a bytes object. encode() and b'' are equivalent.\n\n```txt\n>>>b'Hello world'\nb'Hello world'\n>>> 'Hello world'.encode()\nb'Hello world'\n```\n\n# 12.3 Retrieving an image over HTTP",

Web scraping is when we write a program that pretends to be a web browser and retrieves pages, then examines the data in those pages looking for patterns.\n\nAs an example, a search engine such as Google will look at the source of one web page and extract the links to other pages and retrieve those pages, extracting links, and so on. Using this technique, Google spiders its way through nearly all of the pages on the web.\n\nGoogle also uses the frequency of links from pages it finds to a particular page as one measure of how “important” a page is and how high the page should appear in its search results.\n\n# 12.7 Parsing HTML using regular expressions\n\nOne simple way to parse HTML is to use regular expressions to repeatedly search for and extract substrings that match a particular pattern.\n\nHere is a simple web page:\n\n```txt\n<h1>The First Page</h1> <p> If you like, you can switch to the <a href=\"http://www.dr-chuck.com/page2.htm\"> Second Page</a>. </p>\n```\n\nWe can construct a well-formed regular expression to match and extract the link values from the above text as follows:\n\n```txt\nhref=\"http[s]?://.+?\"\n```",

A non-greedy match tries to find the smallest possible matching string and a greedy match tries to find the largest possible matching string.\n\nWe add parentheses to our regular expression to indicate which part of our matched string we would like to extract, and produce the following program:\n\nSearch for link values within URL input\nimport urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error\nimport re\nimport ssl\n# Ignore SSL certificate errors\nctx $=$ ssl.create_default_context()\nctx.check_hostname $=$ False\nctxverify_mode $\\equiv$ ssl.CERT_NONE\nurl $=$ input('Enter -')\nhtml $=$ urllib.request.urlopen(url,context=ctx).read()\nlinks $=$ re.findall(b'href $\\coloneqq$ \"（http[s]？://.？）\"\"',html)\nfor link in links: print(linkdecode())\n\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/urlregex.py",

When programs just want to exchange dictionaries, lists, or other internal information with each other, they use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (see www.json.org).

Each element can have some text, some attributes (e.g., hide), and other nested elements.

First, in XML, we can add attributes like “intl” to the “phone” tag. In JSON, we simply have key-value pairs. Also the XML “person” tag is gone, replaced by a set of outer curly braces.\n\nIn general, JSON structures are simpler than XML because JSON has fewer capabilities than XML. But JSON has the advantage that it maps directly to some combination of dictionaries and lists. And since nearly all programming languages have something equivalent to Python’s dictionaries and lists, JSON is a very natural format to have two cooperating programs exchange data.\n\nJSON is quickly becoming the format of choice for nearly all data exchange between applications because of its relative simplicity compared to XML.\n\n# 13.5 Parsing JSON\n\nWe construct our JSON by nesting dictionaries and lists as needed. In this example, we represent a list of users where each user is a set of key-value pairs (i.e., a dictionary). So we have a list of dictionaries.",

Once the JSON has been parsed, we can use the Python index operator to extract the various bits of data for each user. We don’t have to use the JSON library to dig through the parsed JSON, since the returned data is simply native Python structures.\n\nThe output of this program is exactly the same as the XML version above.\n\n```txt\nUser count: 2\nName Chuck\nId 001\nAttribute 2\nName Brent\nId 009\nAttribute 7\n```",

Because the JSON is simpler and more directly maps to native data structures we already have in programming languages, the parsing and data extraction code is usually simpler and more direct when using JSON. But XML is more selfdescriptive than JSON and so there are some applications where XML retains an advantage. For example, most word processors store documents internally using XML rather than JSON.\n\n# 13.6 Application Programming Interfaces\n\nWe now have the ability to exchange data between applications using Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) and a way to represent complex data that we are sending back and forth between these applications using eXtensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).\n\nThe next step is to begin to define and document “contracts” between applications using these techniques. The general name for these application-to-application contracts is Application Program Interfaces (APIs). When we use an API, generally one program makes a set of services available for use by other applications and publishes the APIs (i.e., the “rules”) that must be followed to access the services provided by the program.",

We can go to a single web site and book air travel, hotels, and automobiles all from a single site. The data for hotels is not stored on the airline computers. Instead, the airline computers contact the services on the hotel computers and retrieve the hotel data and present it to the user. When the user agrees to make a hotel reservation using the airline site, the airline site uses another web service on the hotel systems to actually make the reservation. And when it comes time to charge your credit card for the whole transaction, still other computers become involved in the process.",

With these advantages, an SOA system must be carefully designed to have good performance and meet the user’s needs.\n\nWhen an application makes a set of services in its API available over the web, we call these web services.\n\n# 13.7 Security and API usage\n\nIt is quite common that you need an API key to make use of a vendor’s API. The general idea is that they want to know who is using their services and how much each user is using. Perhaps they have free and pay tiers of their services or have a policy that limits the number of requests that a single individual can make during a particular time period.\n\nSometimes once you get your API key, you simply include the key as part of POST data or perhaps as a parameter on the URL when calling the API.\n\nOther times, the vendor wants increased assurance of the source of the requests and so they expect you to send cryptographically signed messages using shared keys and secrets. A very common technology that is used to sign requests over the Internet is called OAuth. You can read more about the OAuth protocol at www.oauth.net.",

There are many ways to write programs and by now, you probably have written some programs that are “not so elegant” and other programs that are “more elegant”. Even though your programs may be small, you are starting to see how there is a bit of art and aesthetic to writing code.\n\nAs programs get to be millions of lines long, it becomes increasingly important to write code that is easy to understand. If you are working on a million-line program, you can never keep the entire program in your mind at the same time. We need ways to break large programs into multiple smaller pieces so that we have less to look at when solving a problem, fix a bug, or add a new feature.\n\nIn a way, object oriented programming is a way to arrange your code so that you can zoom into 50 lines of the code and understand it while ignoring the other 999,950 lines of code for the moment.\n\n# 14.2 Getting started\n\nLike many aspects of programming, it is necessary to learn the concepts of object oriented programming before you can use them effectively. You should approach this chapter as a way to learn some terms and concepts and work through a few simple examples to lay a foundation for future learning.",

Python provides us with many built-in objects. Here is some simple code where the first few lines should feel very simple and natural to you.\n\n```python\nstuff = list()\nstuff.append('python')\nstuff.append('chuck')\nstuff.sort()\nprint(stuff[0])\nprint(stuff.__*_0)\nprint(list.__*_stuff, 0))\n```\n\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/objects.py\n\nInstead of focusing on what these lines accomplish, let’s look at what is really happening from the point of view of object-oriented programming. Don’t worry if the following paragraphs don’t make any sense the first time you read them because we have not yet defined all of these terms.\n\nThe first line constructs an object of type list, the second and third lines call the append() method, the fourth line calls the sort() method, and the fifth line retrieves the item at position 0.\n\nThe sixth line calls the __getitem__() method in the stuff list with a parameter of zero.\n\nprint (stuff.__getitem__(0))\n\nThe seventh line is an even more verbose way of retrieving the 0th item in the list.\n\nprint (list.__getitem__(stuff,0))",

The input and output aspects are where the program interacts with the outside world. Within the program we have code and data to accomplish the task the program is designed to solve.\n\nOne way to think about object-oriented programming is that it separates our program into multiple “zones.” Each zone contains some code and data (like a program) and has well defined interactions with the outside world and the other zones within the program.\n\nIf we look back at the link extraction application where we used the BeautifulSoup library, we can see a program that is constructed by connecting different objects together to accomplish a task:\n\n![](images/10c4ccae08d884838bc4eae103cdd62b6d918bfc8291ecaa012cf96a6d373985.jpg)\nFigure 14.1: A Program\n\n```txt\nTo run this, download the BeautifulSoup zip file",

For example, while we need to know how to use the urllib and BeautifulSoup code, we do not need to know how those libraries work internally. This allows us to focus on the part of the problem we need to solve and ignore the other parts of the program.\n\nThis ability to focus exclusively on the part of a program that we care about and ignore the rest is also helpful to the developers of the objects that we use. For example, the programmers developing BeautifulSoup do not need to know or care about how we retrieve our HTML page, what parts we want to read, or what we plan to do with the data we extract from the web page.\n\n# 14.6 Our first Python object\n\nAt a basic level, an object is simply some code plus data structures that are smaller than a whole program. Defining a function allows us to store a bit of code and give it a name and then later invoke that code using the name of the function.",

We can also use type and dir with the classes that we create.\n\nclass PartyAnimal:\n```python\ndef __init__(self):\nself.x = 0\ndef party(self):\nself.x = self.x + 1\nprint(\"So far\", self.x)\n= PartyAnimal()\nint (\"Type\", type(an))\nint (\"Dir \", dir(an))\nint (\"Type\", type(an.x))\nint (\"Type\", type(an parte\n```\n\n```txt\nCode: https://www.py4e.com/code3/party3.py\n```\n\nWhen this program executes, it produces the following output:\n\n```python\nType<class__main__PartyAnimal>\nDir['__class__', '__delattr__', ...\n__sizeof__,'__str__', '__subclasshook__',\n__weakref__,'party', 'x']\nType<class int>\nType<class 'method'>\n```\n\nYou can see that using the class keyword, we have created a new type. From the dir output, you can see both the x integer attribute and the party method are available in the object.\n\n# 14.8 Object lifecycle\n\nIn the previous examples, we define a class (template), use that class to create an instance of that class (object), and then use the instance. When the program finishes, all of the variables are discarded. Usually, we don’t think much about the creation and destruction of variables, but often as our objects become more complex, we need to take some action within the object to set things up as the object is constructed and possibly clean things up as the object is discarded.",

When Python encounters the line:\n\n```txt\nan = 42\n```\n\nIt actually “throws our object away” so it can reuse the an variable to store the value 42. Just at the moment when our an object is being “destroyed” our destructor code (__del__) is called. We cannot stop our variable from being destroyed, but we can do any necessary cleanup right before our object no longer exists.\n\nWhen developing objects, it is quite common to add a constructor to an object to set up initial values for the object. It is relatively rare to need a destructor for an object.\n\n# 14.9 Multiple instances",

However, the real power in object-oriented programming happens when we construct multiple instances of our class.\n\nWhen we construct multiple objects from our class, we might want to set up different initial values for each of the objects. We can pass data to the constructors to give each object a different initial value:\n\nclass PartyAnimal:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, nam):\nself.x = 0\nself.name = nam\nprint(self.name, 'constructed')\ndef party(self):\nself.x = self.x + 1\nprint(self.name, 'party count', self.x)\ns = PartyAnimal('Sally')\ns.party()\nj = PartyAnimal('Jim')\nj.party()\ns.party()\n```\n\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/party5.py\n\nThe constructor has both a self parameter that points to the object instance and additional parameters that are passed into the constructor as the object is constructed:\n\n```txt\ns = PartyAnimal('Sally')\n```\n\nWithin the constructor, the second line copies the parameter (nam) that is passed into the name attribute within the object instance.\n\n```txt\nself.name = nam\n```\n\nThe output of the program shows that each of the objects (s and j) contain their own independent copies of x and nam:\n\n```txt\nSally constructed Sally party count 1 Jim constructed Jim party count 1 Sally party count 2\n```\n\n# 14.10 Inheritance",

When extending a class, we call the original class the parent class and the new class the child class.\n\nFor this example, we move our PartyAnimal class into its own file. Then, we can ‘import’ the PartyAnimal class in a new file and extend it, as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom party import PartyAnimal\n```\n\n```txt\nclass CricketFan(PartyAnimal):\n```\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, nam):\nsuper().__init__(nam)\nself.points = 0\ndef six(self):\nself.points = self.points + 6\nself.group()\nprint(self.name, \"points\", self(points))\ns = PartyAnimal(\"Sally\")\ns.group()\nj = CricketFan(\"Jim\")\nj.group()\nj-six()\nprint(dir(j))\n```\n\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/party6.py\n\nWhen we define the CricketFan class, we indicate that we are extending the PartyAnimal class. This means that all of the variables (x) and methods (party) from the PartyAnimal class are inherited by the CricketFan class. For example,\n\nwithin the six method in the CricketFan class, we call the party method from the PartyAnimal class.\n\nWe use a special syntax in the __init__() method in the CricketFan class to ensure that we call the __init__() method in the PartyAnimal so that whatever setup that PartyAnimal needs is done in addition to the setup needed for the CricketFan extensions.",

    {
        "content": "```python\ndef __init__(self, nam):\nsuper().__init__(nam)\nselfpoints = 0\n```\n\nThe super() syntax is telling Python to call the __init__ method in the class that we are extending. PartyAnimal is the super (or parent) class and CricketFan is the sub (or child) class.\n\nAs the program executes, we create s and j as independent instances of PartyAnimal and CricketFan. The j object has additional capabilities beyond the s object.\n\n```txt\nSally constructed\nSally party count 1\nJim constructed\nJim party count 1\nJim party count 2\nJim points 6\n['__class__, '__delattr__, ... '__weakref__, 'name', 'party', 'points', 'six', 'x']\n```\n\nIn the dir output for the j object (instance of the CricketFan class), we see that it has the attributes and methods of the parent class, as well as the attributes and methods that were added when the class was extended to create the CricketFan class.\n\n# 14.11 Summary\n\nThis is a very quick introduction to object-oriented programming that focuses mainly on terminology and the syntax of defining and using objects. Let’s quickly review the code that we looked at in the beginning of the chapter. At this point you should fully understand what is going on.\n\n```python\nstuff = list()\nstuff.append('python')\nstuff.append('chuck')\nstuff.sort()\nprint(stuff[0])\nprint(stuff.__*_0)\nprint(list.__*_0)\n```\n\n# Code: https://www.py4e.com/code3/objects.py",

When Python creates the list object, it calls the constructor method (named __init__) to set up the internal data attributes that will be used to store the list data. We have not passed any parameters to the constructor. When the constructor returns, we use the variable stuff to point to the returned instance of the list class.\n\nThe second and third lines call the append method with one parameter to add a new item at the end of the list by updating the attributes within stuff. Then in the fourth line, we call the sort method with no parameters to sort the data within the stuff object.\n\nWe then print out the first item in the list using the square brackets which are a shortcut to calling the __getitem__ method within the stuff. This is equivalent to calling the __getitem__ method in the list class and passing the stuff object as the first parameter and the position we are looking for as the second parameter.\n\nAt the end of the program, the stuff object is discarded but not before calling the destructor (named __del__) so that the object can clean up any loose ends as necessary.\n\nThose are the basics of object-oriented programming. There are many additional details as to how to best use object-oriented approaches when developing large applications and libraries that are beyond the scope of this chapter.3\n\n# 14.12 Glossary\n\nattribute A variable that is part of a class.",

Most databases are organized like a dictionary in the sense that they map from keys to values. The biggest difference is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage), so it persists after the program ends. Because a database is stored on permanent storage, it can store far more data than a dictionary, which is limited to the size of the memory in the computer.\n\nLike a dictionary, database software is designed to keep the inserting and accessing of data very fast, even for large amounts of data. Database software maintains its performance by building indexes as data is added to the database to allow the computer to jump quickly to a particular entry.\n\nThere are many different database systems which are used for a wide variety of purposes including: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. We focus on SQLite in this book because it is a very common database and is already built into Python. SQLite is designed to be embedded into other applications to provide database support within the application. For example, the Firefox browser also uses the SQLite database internally as do many other products.\n\nhttp://sqlite.org/",

You will do simple operations in the database manager and more complex operations will be most conveniently done in Python.\n\n# 15.4 Creating a database table\n\nDatabases require more defined structure than Python lists or dictionaries1.\n\nWhen we create a database table we must tell the database in advance the names of each of the columns in the table and the type of data which we are planning to store in each column.

The DELETE command shows the use of a WHERE clause that allows us to express a selection criterion so that we can ask the database to apply the command to only the rows that match the criterion. In this example the criterion happens to apply to all the rows so we empty the table out so we can run the program repeatedly. After the DELETE is performed, we also call commit() to force the data to be removed from the database.\n\n# 15.5 Structured Query Language summary\n\nSo far, we have been using the Structured Query Language in our Python examples and have covered many of the basics of the SQL commands. In this section, we look at the SQL language in particular and give an overview of SQL syntax.\n\nSince there are so many different database vendors, the Structured Query Language (SQL) was standardized so we could communicate in a portable manner to database systems from multiple vendors.\n\nA relational database is made up of tables, rows, and columns. The columns generally have a type such as text, numeric, or date data. When we create a table, we indicate the names and types of the columns:\n\nCREATE TABLE Track (title TEXT, plays INTEGER)\n\nTo insert a row into a table, we use the SQL INSERT command:",

        "content": "CREATE TABLE Track (title TEXT, plays INTEGER)\n\nTo insert a row into a table, we use the SQL INSERT command:\n\nINSERT INTO Track (title, plays) VALUES ('My Way', 15)\n\nThe INSERT statement specifies the table name, then a list of the fields/columns that you would like to set in the new row, and then the keyword VALUES and a list of corresponding values for each of the fields.\n\nThe SQL SELECT command is used to retrieve rows and columns from a database. The SELECT statement lets you specify which columns you would like to retrieve as well as a WHERE clause to select which rows you would like to see. It also allows an optional ORDER BY clause to control the sorting of the returned rows.\n\nSELECT $^ *$ FROM Track WHERE title $=$ 'My Way'\n\nUsing $^ *$ indicates that you want the database to return all of the columns for each row that matches the WHERE clause.\n\nNote, unlike in Python, in a SQL WHERE clause we use a single equal sign to indicate a test for equality rather than a double equal sign. Other logical operations allowed in a WHERE clause include <, >, <=, >=, !=, as well as AND and OR and parentheses to build your logical expressions.\n\nYou can request that the returned rows be sorted by one of the fields as follows:\n\nSELECT title,plays FROM Track ORDER BY title\n\nIt is possible to UPDATE a column or columns within one or more rows in a table using the SQL UPDATE statement as follows:\n\nUPDATE Track SET plays = 16 WHERE title = 'My Way'",

A single UPDATE statement will change all of the rows that match the WHERE clause. If a WHERE clause is not specified, it performs the UPDATE on all of the rows in the table.\n\nTo remove a row, you need a WHERE clause on an SQL DELETE statement. The WHERE clause determines which rows are to be deleted:\n\nDELETE FROM Track WHERE title = 'My Way'\n\nThese four basic SQL commands (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE) allow the four basic operations needed to create and maintain data. We use “CRUD” (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) to capture all these concepts in a single term.2\n\n# 15.6 Multiple tables and basic data modeling\n\nThe real power of a relational database is when we create multiple tables and make links between those tables. The act of deciding how to break up your application data into multiple tables and establishing the relationships between the tables is called data modeling. The design document that shows the tables and their relationships is called a data model.\n\nData modeling is a relatively sophisticated skill and we will only introduce the most basic concepts of relational data modeling in this section.

We have violated the rules of database normalization.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization\n\nWhile database normalization seems very complex on the surface and contains a lot of mathematical justifications, for now we can reduce it all into one simple rule that we will follow.\n\nWe should never put the same string data in a column more than once. If we need the data more than once, we create a numeric key for the data and reference the actual data using this key. Especially if the multiple entries refer to the same object.",

And what would happen if we decided his eye color was ‘Light Blue’? Something just does not feel right.\n\nThe correct solution is to create a table for the each Artist and store all the data about the artist in that table. And then somehow we need to make a connection between a row in the Track table to a row in the Artist table. Perhaps we could call this “link” between two “tables” a “relationship” between two tables. And that is exactly what database experts decided to all these links.\n\nLets make an Artist table as follows:\n\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS Artist; CREATE TABLE Artist (name TEXT, eyes TEXT); INSERT INTO Artist (name, eyes) VALUES ('Frank Sinatra', 'blue');",

To do this, we need what we call ‘keys’. These keys will just be integer numbers that we can use to lookup a row in different table. If we are going to make links to rows inside of a table, we need to add a primary key to the rows in the table. By convention we usually name the primary key column ‘id’. So our Artist table looks as follows:\n\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS Artist; CREATE TABLE Artist (id INTEGER, name TEXT, eyes TEXT); INSERT INTO Artist (id, name, eyes) VALUES (42, 'Frank Sinatra', 'blue');\n\nNow we have a row in the table for ‘Frank Sinatra’ (and his eye color) and a primary key of ‘42’ to use to link our tracks to him. So we alter our Track table as follows:\n\n```sql\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS Track;\nCREATE TABLE Track (title TEXT, plays INTEGER, artist_id INTEGER);\nINSERT INTO Track (title, plays, artist_id) VALUES ('My Way', 15, 42);\nINSERT INTO Track (title, plays, artist_id) VALUES ('New York', 25, 42);\n```\n\nThe artist_id column is an integer, and by naming convention is a foreign key pointing at a primary key in the Artist table.

So the track end is shown with the crow’s foot spread out indicating it is the\" “many” end. The artist end is shown with a vertical like that indicates “one”. There will be “many” artists in general, but the important aspect is that for each artist there will be many tracks. And each of those artists may be associated with multiple tracks.\n\nYou will note that the column that holds the foreign_key like artist_id is on the “many” end and the primary key is at the “one” end.",

The columns are thought of as “implementation detail” to capture the nature of the relationship details and not an essential part of the data being modeled.\n\n# 15.8 Automatically creating primary keys\n\nIn the above example, we arbitrarily assigned Frank the primary key of 42. However when we are inserting millions or rows, it is nice to have the database automatically generate the values for the id column. We do this by declaring the id column as a PRIMARY KEY and leave out the id value when inserting the row:\n\n```sql\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS Artist;\nCREATE TABLE Artist (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, eyes TEXT);\nINSERT INTO Artist (name, eyes) VALUES ('Frank Sinatra', 'blue');\n```\n\nNow we have instructed the database to auto-assign us a unique value to the Frank Sinatra row.

One way is to use a SELECT statement to retrieve data from an SQLite built-in-function called last_insert_rowid().",

By using an intermediate table we break a many-tomany relationship into two one-to-many relationships.

If we add an instructor_id to the Course table it will not work because a course can have multiple instructors. And there is no one-to-many hack that can deal with the fact that the number of roles will expand into roles like Teaching Assistant or Parent.\n\nBut if we simply add a role column to the Member table - we can represent a wide range of roles, role combinations, etc.\n\nLets change our member table as follows:\n\nDROP TABLE Member;\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Member (user_id INTEGER, course_id INTEGER, role INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY (user_id, course_id));\n```",

It is more complicated to write the code to use a database to store data than Python dictionaries or flat files so there is little reason to use a database unless your application truly needs the capabilities of a database. The situations where a database can be quite useful are: (1) when your application needs to make many small random updates within a large data set, (2) when your data is so large it cannot fit in a dictionary and you need to look up information repeatedly, or (3) when you have a long-running process that you want to be able to stop and restart and retain the data from one run to the next.",

When you start making links between tables, it is important to do some thoughtful design and follow the rules of database normalization to make the best use of the database’s capabilities. Since the primary motivation for using a database is that you have a large amount of data to deal with, it is important to model your data efficiently so your programs run as fast as possible.\n\n# 15.15 Debugging\n\nOne common pattern when you are developing a Python program to connect to an SQLite database will be to run a Python program and check the results using the Database Browser for SQLite. The browser allows you to quickly check to see if your program is working properly.\n\nYou must be careful because SQLite takes care to keep two programs from changing the same data at the same time. For example, if you open a database in the browser and make a change to the database and have not yet pressed the “save” button in the browser, the browser “locks” the database file and keeps any other program from accessing the file. In particular, your Python program will not be able to access the file if it is locked.",

The following mapping was added to the Sakai data:\n\niupui.edu -> indiana.edu\n\nso all the accounts from the various Indiana University campuses are tracked together.\n\nYou can rerun the gmodel.py over and over as you look at the data, and add mappings to make the data cleaner and cleaner. When you are done, you will have a nicely indexed version of the email in index.sqlite. This is the file to use to do data analysis. With this file, data analysis will be really quick.\n\nThe first, simplest data analysis is to determine “who sent the most mail?” and “which organization sent the most mail”? This is done using gbasic.py:",

Downey)\n\nIn January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.",

        "content": "One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.\n\nTwo weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:\n\n• Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.\n\n• Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon and define each term at first use.\n• Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult topics and split them into a series of small steps.\n• Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.\n\nI needed a title, so on a whim I chose How to Think Like a Computer Scientist.\n\nMy first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most important) letting the students practice.\n\nI released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.",

        "content": "I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.\n\nWhat happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book.\n\nJeff and I revised the book, incorporated a case study by Chris Meyers, and in 2001 we released How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python, also under the GNU Free Documentation License. As Green Tea Press, I published the book and started selling hard copies through Amazon.com and college book stores. Other books from Green Tea Press are available at greenteapress.com.\n\nIn 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the first time. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.\n\nOver the last five years I have continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some of the examples and adding material, especially exercises. In 2008 I started work on a major revision—at the same time, I was contacted by an editor at Cambridge University Press who was interested in publishing the next edition. Good timing!\n\nI hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think, at least a little bit, like a computer scientist.",
