As this field of study is now well developed, it is not too difficult to find authors and teachers for a new course.

Most investment managers believe that understanding this force of compulsion is a key to understanding a financial market when it appears to be behaving irrationally.

Significant modifications for this particularly difficult subject were required. Even more distillation of the materials was needed to convert these distance learning materials into a series of lectures lasting not more than ten hours.

Notes and coin and demand deposits tend to be held for transactions purposes and are called narrow money. Notes and coin do not earn any interest, and demand deposits have a lower rate of interest than that on time deposits. When interest rates rise, people tend to run down holdings of notes and coin and demand deposits and switch into time deposits. Hence, narrow money tends to fall when the level of interest rates rises, and the opposite happens when interest rates fall.",

The behaviour of a crowd is different from the sum of the behaviour of individuals if they are acting in isolation. Patterns in the charts follow, as will be explained in Chapter 12.

Indeed, the final rise in a market just before a bubble bursts is frequently hectic. Departing from the herd can be very risky. An investment manager can lose his job.

Unfortunately for them, prices continued to rise and the short-run performance of the funds concerned became worse than that of their competitors.

The banks had to find these funds from somewhere. In practice, they were supplied by the Bank when giving ‘assistance’ to the money market, as described in the previous chapter. The left hand of the Bank squeezed the system and the right hand of the Bank undid the squeeze. At first sight, this appears to be a contradiction.

Bank lending to the private sector will, however, tend to do the opposite, rising in a boom and falling in a recession. The fluctuations in bank lending tend to be greater than those in the PSNCR and, because of this, broad money may fall when the PSNCR increases and rise when the PSNCR decreases.

The possibilities of losses, as well as high profits, are included in the average. The expected yield should not be confused with the most likely yield.\n- Risk implies an adverse outcome – that is, below average return or loss.1\n- Some academics focus on the volatility of a stock’s price. This is a good measure of risk if the probability of below average return is symmetrical with the probability of above average return. If there is no symmetry, volatility is a bad measure of risk.",

The latest plot on a graph running ahead of the moving average (that is, further along the trend line) is evidence that the trend is intact. Another technique is to draw graphs through the peaks of the short-term fluctuations, and through their troughs, to find out whether the trends in these are similar to that of the moving average.",

From it the author learnt about production, income and expenditure in the economy as a  \nwhole. Producers produce goods. Income is earned from such production. Expenditure occurs when income is spent on the goods made by producers. Hence, production leads to income, which leads to expenditure, which leads to further production, and so on. This illustrated that the macroeconomic system is dynamic.",

The outflow was the demand for finance for capital formation, for example, for industrial investment. The level of liquid in the tank at any one time was the current height of the stock market.

The second step was to adjust the scales of the indices so that the rise in the equity market over the period was the same as the fall in the gilt-edged market. The final step was to add the two indices together – that is, equities and gilt-edged stocks were given equal weights.

Ordinary share prices tend to have a peak turning point when the rate of growth of the money supply has fallen significantly. The most important factor is a change in the rate of growth of the money supply, but the level is also relevant. A fall from a low rate of monetary growth is significant more quickly than a fall from a high rate of growth. Conversely, ordinary share prices tend to have a trough turning point when the rate of growth of the money supply has risen by a significant amount, with a rise from a high level being significant more quickly than a rise from a low",

Data are available for the deposits and loans of these subsectors, quarterly from 1963 and monthly since 1997.",

Professor Tim Congdon has studied the behaviour of each sector (Congdon, 2004a, 2004b, 2005). He has found that the disequilibria of households are relatively minor. The disequilibria of nonbank financial institutions and of industrial and commercial companies are much more important. He finds, unsurprisingly, that the disequilibria  \nof non-bank financial institutions are important for asset prices, whereas those of industrial and commercial companies are important for economic activity.",

For industrial and commercial companies, he focuses on the ratio of their money balances to their bank borrowing. If these companies are being squeezed financially, they lay off labour, attempt to reduce stocks and cut back on investment, all of which reduce economic activity, and so on.",
